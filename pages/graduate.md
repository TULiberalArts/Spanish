## Program Goals
The Graduate Program in Spanish integrates the study of the three fundamental fields of Hispanic Studies: Peninsular Spanish Literature, Spanish American Literature and Hispanic Linguistics. At the level of the Master of Arts, it provides a solid program developing advanced Spanish-language skills for diverse careers (in secondary education, business, health and government services, and interpretation and translation) and trains students in the exercise of pedagogical and research skills necessary for the pursuit of a PhD. At the Doctor of Philosophy level, the program provides opportunities for advanced study and research in selected fields in Hispanic studies, and trains scholar/teachers for careers principally at institutions of higher learning. The MA and PhD degrees may be completed on a full-time or part-time basis.

## Graduate Language Exam
- The Spanish and Portuguese Graduate Language Reading Examinations are administered four times per year: twice during the fall semester and twice during the spring semester. We also administer Catalan exams in our department by request. The department will notify students of their exam results by email.
