# Study Abroad

## Latin American Studies Semester (LASS)

## Program Overview

The Latin American Studies Semester (LASS) has been offered every spring semester since 1973. This unique language immersion program is designed to provide an intensive experience in the study of the Spanish language in combination with an interdisciplinary study of life and contemporary issues in Latin America. The prerequisite for participation in LASS is two semesters of university-level Spanish or the equivalent (students with more advanced levels of course background are encouraged to participate in the program). LASS integrates several courses, totaling 17-semester hours credit, and must be taken as a package. All courses are taught in Spanish from the first day of class on Temple’s main campus. An integral part of the LASS program is a three-week trip to Heredia, Costa Rica in February and March, during which students are placed in local homes where the only language of communication is Spanish. While in Costa Rica, students attend courses at the National University of Costa Rica. All courses in Costa Rica are taught by native Spanish-speaking professors and by Temple University professors. All participants in the program may expect to achieve marked improvement in Spanish fluency in only one semester.

## Courses

LASS courses combine the learning of the Spanish language with the study of the diverse cultures of Latin America. The program is an integration of several courses, totaling 17-semester hours credit, and must be taken as a package. Owing to both the credit-hour load and the semester’s objective: immersion in Spanish and Latin American Studies, no other courses may be taken. Students register for the following courses:

- **Spanish 2098**: Intensive Practice/Four Skills – 9 credits.
- **Sociology 2163**: Area Studies: Latin American Development – 3 credits.
- **Spanish 3204**: Latin America Through Film – 3 credits.
- **Latin American Studies 2220**: LASS Seminar – 2 credits.

Morning sessions, held from 9:00 to 12:00 on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, offer Spanish language instruction and conversation practice at intermediate and advanced levels guided by native or near native speakers. Morning sessions, held from 9:30 to 10:50 and from 11:00 to 12:20 on Tuesdays and Thursdays, focus on Latin American culture, history, and economic development. A LASS Seminar held on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1:30 to 3:10 highlights a series of topics in Latin American and Latino studies and includes films and presentations by guest speakers.

## About Heredia, Costa Rica

Heredia is a city that is emblematic of the Costa Rican lifestyle and makes for a perfect study abroad destination. It is located only a short distance from San José, the capital city of Costa Rica, and offers many big-city amenities. The relaxed city lifestyle allows students to enjoy scenic plazas, abundant green spaces and parks, and friendly ticos (Costa Ricans). Winding through the twisting roads above Heredia, charming little towns are surrounded by coffee plantations and lush vegetation, with occasional views of the Central Valley below. Almost everything Costa Rica has to offer can be found in and around Heredia, including the Central Volcanic Corridor, a sloth reserve, and other popular destinations. Costa Rica is known for the warmth of its welcome and the beauty of its countryside, an ideal combination for students.

## The National University Of Costa Rica

Founded in 1973, the National University of Costa Rica – Heredia (Universidad Nacional de Costa Rica or UNA) is the second-largest university in the country. The school’s undergraduate and graduate programs are fully accredited, and over 15,000 students study at its main campus. In addition to undergraduate programs, it offers 16 Masters of Art degrees and is strong in ecology, sociology, and education related coursework. While in Costa Rica, LASS students will have access to campus Wi-Fi, computer labs and the library.

## Accommidations

Housing in Heredia allows students a truly enjoyable and immersive experience living in a Costa Rican (Tico) home with a local family (only one LASS student per each host family for maximum cultural and language engagement). All housing is located in middle to upper class neighborhoods and offers glimpses of everyday life with easy access to the university and to city amenities. Home stays include breakfast and dinner every day except for excursion days. Every family has been carefully selected by UNA staff in order to ensure a comfortable, enjoyable and immersive living situation.

## Brazil: Afro-Brazilian Culture And Popular Brazilian Music (Salvador, Bahia)

Our summer study abroad programs allow you to use the world as your classroom. Students choose to study abroad during the summer for a variety of reasons. Many have academic requirements that do not allow them to spend an entire semester abroad. Some students want to improve their language skills, while others seek to experience daily life in another country. Many students participate in short-term summer programs early in their college education, and then spend a semester or year abroad as juniors or seniors.

Temple University in Brazil provides exceptional educational opportunities for under graduate students of African-American studies, Latin American studies, Portuguese, history, music, dance, art and related disciplines to study Brazilian culture, civilization and music.
