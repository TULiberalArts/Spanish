Learn Spanish for Healthcare Professionals
{:.fake-h2}

If you’re a Philadelphia area nurse, physician or other health care provider, you know the importance of clearly communicating with the nearly 15% of Philadelphians who are Latinx.* Temple University’s fully online Spanish for Healthcare Professions Graduate Certificate program will teach you how to converse more effectively with patients, empowering you to provide them with the best medical care possible.
As a student, you’ll hone and improve your oral, aural, reading, and writing skills. You’ll also learn basic Spanish interpretation and translation techniques while focusing on Spanish medical terminology and cultural practices relative to patient-provider interactions in health care settings. As a graduate, you’ll then be able to more effectively interact and serve Latinx patients.
