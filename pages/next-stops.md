# Study Abroad

## Latin American Studies Semester (LASS)

## Program Overview

The Latin American Studies Semester (LASS) has been offered every spring semester since 1973. This unique language immersion program is designed to provide an intensive experience in the study of the Spanish language in combination with an interdisciplinary study of life and contemporary issues in Latin America. The prerequisite for participation in LASS is two semesters of university-level Spanish or the equivalent (students with more advanced levels of course background are encouraged to participate in the program). LASS integrates several courses, totaling 17-semester hours credit, and must be taken as a package. All courses are taught in Spanish from the first day of class on Temple’s main campus. An integral part of the LASS program is a three-week trip to Heredia, Costa Rica in February and March, during which students are placed in local homes where the only language of communication is Spanish. While in Costa Rica, students attend courses at the National University of Costa Rica. All courses in Costa Rica are taught by native Spanish-speaking professors and by Temple University professors. All participants in the program may expect to achieve marked improvement in Spanish fluency in only one semester.

## Courses

LASS courses combine the learning of the Spanish language with the study of the diverse cultures of Latin America. The program is an integration of several courses, totaling 17-semester hours credit, and must be taken as a package. Owing to both the credit-hour load and the semester’s objective: immersion in Spanish and Latin American Studies, no other courses may be taken. Students register for the following courses:

- **Spanish 2098**: Intensive Practice/Four Skills – 9 credits.
- **Sociology 2163**: Area Studies: Latin American Development – 3 credits.
- **Spanish 3204**: Latin America Through Film – 3 credits.
- **Latin American Studies 2220**: LASS Seminar – 2 credits.

Morning sessions, held from 9:00 to 12:00 on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, offer Spanish language instruction and conversation practice at intermediate and advanced levels guided by native or near native speakers. Morning sessions, held from 9:30 to 10:50 and from 11:00 to 12:20 on Tuesdays and Thursdays, focus on Latin American culture, history, and economic development. A LASS Seminar held on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1:30 to 3:10 highlights a series of topics in Latin American and Latino studies and includes films and presentations by guest speakers.

## About Quito, Ecuador

High in the Andean mountain range, you’ll find the capital city of Quito. Quito combines modern infrastructure with centuries of history and culture, making it an ideal study abroad destination.

The metro area fills the space between lush mountains (and a couple of volcanoes), creating a gorgeous setting for living and exploring. Quito provides many options for learning and entertainment, and students are encouraged to explore their interests – and develop new ones. This is a wonderful place for music, architecture, hiking, food, dancing, and sports.

## Andean Center For Latin American Studies

The Andean Center for Latin American Studies (ACLAS) is students’ home campus. For over 25 years, ACLAS has hosted U.S. university study abroad programs and supported students through intensive Spanish-language learning, homestay family experiences and travel throughout Ecuador.

## Accommidations

Living with host families in Quito allows students a truly immersive experience. These local families host one LASS student each for maximum cultural and language engagement. Students routinely rate the homestay experience as their favorite part of studying abroad.

All housing offers glimpses of everyday life, with easy access to ACLAS and to city amenities. Homestays include three meals a day (except excursion days) and laundry. Every family has been carefully selected by ACLAS staff in order to ensure a comfortable, enjoyable living situation.

## Brazil: Afro-Brazilian Culture And Popular Brazilian Music (Salvador, Bahia)

Our summer study abroad programs allow you to use the world as your classroom. Students choose to study abroad during the summer for a variety of reasons. Many have academic requirements that do not allow them to spend an entire semester abroad. Some students want to improve their language skills, while others seek to experience daily life in another country. Many students participate in short-term summer programs early in their college education, and then spend a semester or year abroad as juniors or seniors.

Temple University in Brazil provides exceptional educational opportunities for under graduate students of African-American studies, Latin American studies, Portuguese, history, music, dance, art and related disciplines to study Brazilian culture, civilization and music.
