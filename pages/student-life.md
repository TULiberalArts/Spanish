## Internships
The Department of Spanish and Portuguese maintains relationships with a variety of organizations throughout the city of Philadelphia offering students ample volunteer, community service, research and internship opportunities.  These experiential learning experiences provide students with real world language and work experience, increasing their skills and confidence.

Throughout the academic year, students of any level may volunteer with educational and neighborhood organizations, such as mentoring primary and high school students, teaching seniors or contributing to the greening of the city infrastructure.  In the summer, advanced students may receive credit by taking an Internship course for which they invest significant time in an organization. Students have been engaged in service opportunities in journalism, social services, law, heath care, educational development and immigrant rights. By using their language skills to fulfill their responsibilities, students maximize their classroom learning and attain poise in a professional setting.

## Latin American Studies Semester (LASS)
The Latin American Studies Semester (LASS) has been offered every spring semester since 1973. This unique language immersion program is designed to provide an intensive experience in the study of the Spanish language in combination with an interdisciplinary study of life and contemporary issues in Latin America. The prerequisite for participation in LASS is one semester of university-level Spanish or the equivalent (students with more advanced levels of course background are encouraged to participate in the program). LASS integrates several courses, totaling 17-semester hours credit, and must be taken as a package. All courses are taught in Spanish from the first day of class on Temple’s main campus. An integral part of the LASS program is a three-week trip to Quito, Ecuador in March, during which students are placed in local homes where the only language of communication is Spanish. While in Ecuador, students attend courses at the Andean Center for Latin American Studies. Native Spanish-speaking professors teach all courses in Ecuador. All participants in the program may expect to achieve marked improvement in Spanish fluency in only one semester.

### Courses
LASS courses combine the learning of the Spanish language with the study of the diverse cultures of Latin America. The program is an integration of several courses, totaling 17-semester hours credit, and must be taken as a package. Owing to both the credit-hour load and the semester’s objective: immersion in Spanish and Latin American Studies, no other courses may be taken. Students register for the following courses:

- [Spanish 2098: Intensive Practice/Four Skills](http://bulletin.temple.edu/search/?P=SPAN%202098) – 9 credits.
- [Sociology 2163: Area Studies: Latin American Development](http://bulletin.temple.edu/search/?P=SOC%202163) – 3 credits.

- [Latin American Studies 2220: LASS Seminar](http://bulletin.temple.edu/search/?P=LAS%202220) – 2 credits.

Morning sessions, held from 9:00 to 12:00 on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, offer Spanish language instruction and conversation practice at intermediate and advanced levels guided by native or near native speakers. Morning sessions, held from 9:30 to 10:50 and from 11:00 to 12:20 on Tuesdays and Thursdays, focus on Latin American culture, history, and economic development. A LASS Seminar held on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1:30 to 3:10 highlights a series of topics in Latin American and Latino studies and includes films and presentations by guest speakers.

## Study Abroad

## About Quito, Ecuador
High in the Andean mountain range, you’ll find the capital city of Quito. Quito combines modern infrastructure with centuries of history and culture, making it an ideal study abroad destination.

The metro area fills the space between lush mountains (and a couple of volcanoes), creating a gorgeous setting for living and exploring. Quito provides many options for learning and entertainment, and students are encouraged to explore their interests – and develop new ones. This is a wonderful place for music, architecture, hiking, food, dancing, and sports.

### Andean Center for Latin American Studies
The Andean Center for Latin American Studies (ACLAS) is students’ home campus. For over 25 years, ACLAS has hosted U.S. university study abroad programs and supported students through intensive Spanish-language learning, homestay family experiences and travel throughout Ecuador.

### Accomodations
Living with host families in Quito allows students a truly immersive experience. These local families host one LASS student each for maximum cultural and language engagement. Students routinely rate the homestay experience as their favorite part of studying abroad.

All housing offers glimpses of everyday life, with easy access to ACLAS and to city amenities. Homestays include three meals a day (except excursion days) and laundry. Every family has been carefully selected by ACLAS staff in order to ensure a comfortable, enjoyable living situation.

![Brazil Study Abroad]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized Study Abroad Brazil.jpg){:.img-right}
Our summer study abroad programs allow you to use the world as your classroom. Students choose to study abroad during the summer for a variety of reasons. Many have academic requirements that do not allow them to spend an entire semester abroad. Some students want to improve their language skills, while others seek to experience daily life in another country. Many students participate in short-term summer programs early in their college education, and then spend a semester or year abroad as juniors or seniors.

Temple University in Brazil provides exceptional educational opportunities for under graduate students of African-American studies, Latin American studies, Portuguese, history, music, dance, art and related disciplines to study Brazilian culture, civilization and music. For more information visit Temple Summer in Brazil **BROKEN LINK**.

## Awards/Scholarships
Exceptional students may apply to become members of the prestigious Spanish Honor Society: Sigma Delta Pi. A graduating senior is awarded the Sigma Delta Pi prize each year. The Department also offers the Kristina Joanne Chelius award.  Established in 2009 by Thomas and Joanne Chelius in memory of their daughter Kristina, CLA ’91, this award is given to outstanding junior or senior students majoring in Spanish who have financial need.

## Club de Espanol
The Spanish Club is a student organization and its principal goal is to promote the practice of speaking Spanish. One way we achieve this goal is through conversation tables, which allow students to practice their conversation skills in a relaxed environment once a week.  We also celebrate the Hispanic culture all year round with different activities. The Spanish Club meets weekly throughout the semester on Mondays from 4-5pm in 422 Anderson Hall. 

Everyone is welcome to join the Spanish Club. You don’t need to be a member of the club in order to participate in our events throughout the year. Stop by our meetings and bring friends!

## Graduate Students of Language at Temple (GSOLT)
The purpose of Graduate Students of Language at Temple (GSOLT) is to connect students who study and are interested in language in order to form interdisciplinary networks for discussion and research. The organization organizes a conference each spring to showcase students’ research in language from a variety of viewpoints.

GSOLT also promotes interdisciplinary discussion of language and conducts workshops for improving student work. Meetings are held in order to plan the spring conference, upcoming workshops and discuss guest speakers. In workshops we discuss project ideas, current projects and issues we are encountering. We also discuss theory and methods to help us progress in our individual projects and understand approaches to language from different disciplines.

## Hispanic Readings Blog
Welcome to The Hispanic Readings Blog (Spanish 2002/2902) of the Department of Spanish and Portuguese at Temple University.

Hispanic Readings is a course for students interested in the literature and cultures of peoples throughout the Spanish-speaking world. This course will enable students to discover the rich contributions of not only Spain but also Latin America to literature and mass communications (e.g. newspapers, magazines). As students read short stories, essays, and articles, they will deepen their knowledge of the authors and their life experiences as well as examine current trends in literature and journalism.

In this course students will write a short story, which will give them the opportunity to be creative in a language other than English and put into practice what they have learned.

In this blog, we will publish the best stories written by students each semester and include their comments as they make their way through the world of Hispanic readings.

All students taking Hispanic Readings / Lecturas Hispánicas had to write a short story and read several stories in Spanish from various sources. View the following [Student Grpups pdf](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/sites/liberalarts/files/Comentarios%20de%20Hispanic%20Readings%20Fall%202016.pdf) to see the comments from students after the experience during the semester.
