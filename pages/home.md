## Join a Unique and Virbrant Comminuty
The Department of Spanish and Portuguese is a unique and vibrant community of faculty who teach students of all disciplines at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Our three Spanish major tracks (Language and Professional Studies; Language, Literature and Linguistics; and Spanish for Education) prepare students for the pluralistic, globalized society of the 21st century â€” not only through rigorous language training, but also by providing instruction in the cultures and literatures of Spain, Latin America, and the Luso-Brazilian world.
