The Department of Spanish and Portuguese is a unique and vibrant community of faculty who teach students of all disciplines at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Our three Spanish major tracks (Language and Professional Studies; Language, Literature and Linguistics; and Spanish for Education) prepare students for the pluralistic, globalized society of the 21st century â€” not only through rigorous language training, but also by providing instruction in the cultures and literatures of Spain, Latin America, and the Luso-Brazilian world.

Specialized courses in business, legal and medical Spanish and translation skills complement our diverse selection of course offerings that allow majors to tailor their learning toward their professional and intellectual goals.
