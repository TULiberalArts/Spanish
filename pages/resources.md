### Tutoring in Spanish For Writing Courses
The Writing Center is now offering tutoring sessions in Spanish. The sessions are geared primarily to students enrolled in the Writing Intensive courses (Spanish 2096 and 3096), but any Temple student who is writing essays in Spanish is welcome to use the service.

To have a session in Spanish, students must make an appointment with one of the following tutors: Nicole, Nicholas or Megan. The appointments can be made by phone at [215-204-0702](tel:2152040702) or in person. Appointments must be made at least 24 hours in advance. Please note that the appointment schedule often gets fully booked. Whenever possible, students should call on Thursday afternoons for appointments in the following week.
