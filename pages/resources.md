## Awards/Scholarships

Exceptional students may apply to become members of the prestigious Spanish Honor Society: Sigma Delta Pi. A graduating senior is awarded the Sigma Delta Pi prize each year. The Department also offers the Kristina Joanne Chelius award.  Established in 2009 by Thomas and Joanne Chelius in memory of their daughter Kristina, CLA ’91, this award is given to outstanding junior or senior students majoring in Spanish who have financial need.
