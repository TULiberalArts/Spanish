## Program Overview
The Department of Spanish and Portuguese at Temple University prepares students for the pluralistic, globalized society of the 21st century. As a student, you’ll benefit from rigorous language training and a liberal arts education. Through instruction in the languages, cultures and literatures of Spain, Spanish America and the Luso-Brazilian world, students acquire bilingual competency in the quintessential liberal arts skills: clear written and oral communication, problem-solving competencies and real-world experience. Specialized courses in business, criminal justice, and medical Spanish and translation/interpretation skills complement a robust array of language and literature courses. The result is that majors and non-majors are both able to tailor their learning towards their professional and intellectual goals.

In addition to on-campus instruction, the department facilitates student connections with local and global communities through participation in one of our special programs: an intensive immersion program in Spanish and Latin American Studies (LASS); diverse programs abroad, including our Temple Spain Programs; and service learning and internships in areas of business, social service and education in Philadelphia. Students studying in Spanish and Portuguese are well-positioned for life after Temple University’s College of Liberal Arts. Our students attend graduate, law and medical schools; they enter public service through careers in public policy, international relations and education; and they utilize their language skills in the business and health sectors. 

## We Teach—a Lot
Spanish and Portuguese students receive a 360-degree view of our subject matter. From language and culture to literature and business, our students graduate with the skills they need to look at global issues from all angles. And thanks to service learning and internships in business, social services, health and education throughout Philadelphia, students can add the practical experience they need to hit the ground running upon graduation.

## Our Students Are Globetrotters
Spanish and Portuguese students are encouraged to study abroad and immerse themselves in the language and culture of Ecuador and Spain. Study abroad for a summer or for a full academic semester. The choice is yours.

## Immersive Study, Positive Results
