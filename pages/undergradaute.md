## Undergraduate Program Overview

The Department of Spanish and Portuguese at Temple University prepares students for the pluralistic, globalized society of the twenty-first century not only through rigorous language training, but also by providing undergraduates with a liberal arts education. Through instruction in the languages, cultures, and literatures of Spain, Spanish America, and the Luso-Brazilian world, students acquire bilingual competency in the quintessential liberal arts skills: clear written and oral communication, problem solving competencies and real-world experience. Specialized courses in Business, Legal, Medical Spanish and Translation Skills complement the robust array of language and literature course offerings that allow both majors and non-majors to tailor their learning towards their professional and intellectual goals.  In addition to on-campus instruction, the Department facilitates student connections with local and global communities through participation in one of our special programs. These programs include: an intensive immersion program in Spanish and Latin American Studies (LASS); diverse programs abroad, including our Temple Spain Programs; and service learning and internships in areas of business, social service, and education in Philadelphia. Students studying in Spanish and Portuguese are well positioned for life after Temple University. Our students attend graduate, law and medical schools; they enter public service through careers in public policy, international relations and education; and they utilize their language skills in the business and health sectors.

## Curriculum

Students may begin their courses in Spanish and Portuguese at the elemental level where the instruction targets communication skills allowing students to use their second language even after one semester whilst preparing them for the demands of upper level courses. At the low intermediate level, dedicated courses in reading, writing and conversation enhance proficiency as students explore more deeply Hispanic culture. The diversity of courses at the intermediate level allows students to use their language skills to pursue particular interests. Survey courses cover topics such as Spanish or Spanish-American literature, film or culture while professional courses introduce students to relevant cultural practices and vocabulary in sectors such as health care or business. Students majoring in Spanish will polish their written and oral discourse in the writing intensive courses and the advanced level courses. In advanced level courses such as Spanish-English Contrasts, Hispanic Women Writers and Spanish Internship, students delve into their subject producing extended oral and written discourse thus preparing them for graduate study in any discipline and for their future careers.
