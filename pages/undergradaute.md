## Program Overview
The Department of Spanish and Portuguese at Temple University prepares students for the pluralistic, globalized society of the 21st century. As a student, you’ll benefit from rigorous language training and a liberal arts education. Through instruction in the languages, cultures and literatures of Spain, Spanish America and the Luso-Brazilian world, students acquire bilingual competency in the quintessential liberal arts skills: clear written and oral communication, problem-solving competencies and real-world experience. Specialized courses in business, criminal justice, and medical Spanish and translation/interpretation skills complement a robust array of language and literature courses. The result is that both majors and non-majors are both able to tailor their learning towards their professional and intellectual goals.

In addition to on-campus instruction, the department facilitates student connections with local and global communities through participation in one of our special programs: an intensive immersion program in Spanish and Latin American Studies (LASS); diverse programs abroad, including our Temple Spain Programs; and community engagement learning and internships in areas of business, social service and education in Philadelphia. Students studying in Spanish and Portuguese are well positioned for life after Temple. After graduation, our students take on careers in the public and private sectors, working in fields such as international relations and education, while others continue their studies, attending law, medical and graduate schools. Regardless of the context, our students’ language and analytic skills distinguish them from their peers.
