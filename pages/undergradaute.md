## We Teach. A Lot.

We offer a 360-degree view of our subject matter. From language and culture to literature and business, we make sure students graduate with the skills they need to look at global issues from all angles.

## Our Students Are Globetrotters

Our department offers study abroad programs that allow students to immerse themselves in the language and culture of Costa Rica, Spain and Brazil. Study abroad for a summer or for a full academic semester. The choice is yours.

## Work Before Graduation

We offer service learning and internships in the areas of business, social services, health and education â€” right here in Philadelphia.

## Immersive Study. Positive Results.

Our students graduate with career aptitudes such as research and information literacy, multicultural and interpersonal skills, and marked improvement in formal and informal written and oral communication. Through multidisciplinary coursework, students hone their analytic and creative thinking skills and are better able to generate conclusions and solutions.
