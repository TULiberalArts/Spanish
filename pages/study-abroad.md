## About Quito, Ecuador
High in the Andean mountain range, you’ll find the capital city of Quito. Quito combines modern infrastructure with centuries of history and culture, making it an ideal study abroad destination.

The metro area fills the space between lush mountains (and a couple of volcanoes), creating a gorgeous setting for living and exploring. Quito provides many options for learning and entertainment, and students are encouraged to explore their interests – and develop new ones. This is a wonderful place for music, architecture, hiking, food, dancing, and sports.

### Andean Center for Latin American Studies
The Andean Center for Latin American Studies (ACLAS) is students’ home campus. For over 25 years, ACLAS has hosted U.S. university study abroad programs and supported students through intensive Spanish-language learning, homestay family experiences and travel throughout Ecuador.

### Accomodations
Living with host families in Quito allows students a truly immersive experience. These local families host one LASS student each for maximum cultural and language engagement. Students routinely rate the homestay experience as their favorite part of studying abroad.

All housing offers glimpses of everyday life, with easy access to ACLAS and to city amenities. Homestays include three meals a day (except excursion days) and laundry. Every family has been carefully selected by ACLAS staff in order to ensure a comfortable, enjoyable living situation.

### Cost
The 17-semester hours credit program includes an additional fee of $1,000. Please note this fee is subject to change. The fee is incorporated into the tuition for one of the LASS courses and is paid as part of the student spring registration.  The fee covers the following: housing, meals, courses and trips in Ecuador. Students are responsible for separately purchasing their airline tickets and make their own arrangements.

Our summer study abroad programs allow you to use the world as your classroom. Students choose to study abroad during the summer for a variety of reasons. Many have academic requirements that do not allow them to spend an entire semester abroad. Some students want to improve their language skills, while others seek to experience daily life in another country. Many students participate in short-term summer programs early in their college education, and then spend a semester or year abroad as juniors or seniors.
Temple University in Brazil provides exceptional educational opportunities for under graduate students of African-American studies, Latin American studies, Portuguese, history, music, dance, art and related disciplines to study Brazilian culture, civilization and music.

## Latin American Studies Semester (LASS)
The Latin American Studies Semester (LASS) has been offered every spring semester since 1973. This unique language immersion program is designed to provide an intensive experience in the study of the Spanish language in combination with an interdisciplinary study of life and contemporary issues in Latin America. The prerequisite for participation in LASS is one semester of university-level Spanish or the equivalent (students with more advanced levels of course background are encouraged to participate in the program). LASS integrates several courses, totaling 17-semester hours credit, and must be taken as a package. All courses are taught in Spanish from the first day of class on Temple’s main campus. An integral part of the LASS program is a three-week trip to Quito, Ecuador in March, during which students are placed in local homes where the only language of communication is Spanish. While in Ecuador, students attend courses at the Andean Center for Latin American Studies. Native Spanish-speaking professors teach all courses in Ecuador. All participants in the program may expect to achieve marked improvement in Spanish fluency in only one semester.

### Courses
LASS courses combine the learning of the Spanish language with the study of the diverse cultures of Latin America. The program is an integration of several courses, totaling 17-semester hours credit, and must be taken as a package. Owing to both the credit-hour load and the semester’s objective: immersion in Spanish and Latin American Studies, no other courses may be taken. Students register for the following courses:

- [Spanish 2098: Intensive Practice/Four Skills](http://bulletin.temple.edu/search/?P=SPAN%202098) – 9 credits.

- [Latin American Studies 2220: LASS Seminar](http://bulletin.temple.edu/search/?P=LAS%202220) – 2 credits.

Morning sessions, held from 9:00 to 12:00 on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, offer Spanish language instruction and conversation practice at intermediate and advanced levels guided by native or near native speakers. Morning sessions, held from 9:30 to 10:50 and from 11:00 to 12:20 on Tuesdays and Thursdays, focus on Latin American culture, history, and economic development.
