### Program Overview
The Latin American Studies Semester has been offered every spring semester since 1973. This unique language immersion program provides you with an intensive experience studying the Spanish language in combination with an interdisciplinary study of life and contemporary issues in Latin America.

The prerequisite for participation in LASS is one semester of university-level Spanish or the equivalent (students with more advanced levels of course background are encouraged to participate in the program). LASS integrates several courses, totaling 17-semester-hour credits, and must be taken as a package. All courses are taught in Spanish from the first day of class on Temple’s main campus.
An integral part of the LASS program is a three-week trip to Quito, Ecuador in February/March, during which students are placed in local homes where the only language of communication is Spanish. While in Ecuador, students attend courses at the Andean Center for Latin American Studies. Native Spanish-speaking professors teach all courses in Ecuador. All participants in the program may expect to achieve marked improvement in Spanish fluency in only one semester.

The program is an integration of several courses, totaling 17-semester-hour credits, and must be taken as a package.

## About Quito, Ecuador
High in the Andean mountain range, you’ll find the capital city of Quito. Quito combines modern infrastructure with centuries of history and culture, making it an ideal study abroad destination.

The metro area fills the space between lush mountains (and a couple of volcanoes), creating a gorgeous setting for living and exploring. Quito provides many options for learning and entertainment, and students are encouraged to explore their interests–and develop new ones. This is a wonderful place for music, architecture, hiking, food, dancing and sports.

Altitude: Quito has an altitude of around 9,000 feet, which is mighty high for those accustomed to living at lower altitudes. This means that if you’re flying in to Quito from sea level, you’ll be ascending a distance of almost two miles within just a few hours, which may take its toll on your body. Altitude sickness can afflict anyone regardless of age, health or fitness level.  

Physical Demands: Students will need to be able to walk medium distances and take public transportation. The streets of Quito have uneven surfaces in certain parts of the city. Some host family houses do not have elevators, so students may need to walk upstairs to their residences. The program also includes several field trips and activities that will involve walking and perhaps hiking. None are exceptionally strenuous, but if you have concerns or questions about such activities, feel free to contact the program director.  

### Andean Center for Latin American Studies
The Andean Center for Latin American Studies (ACLAS) will be your home campus when you study abroad in Ecuador. For over 25 years, ACLAS has hosted U.S. university study abroad programs and supported students through intensive Spanish language learning, homestay family experiences and travel throughout Ecuador.

### Accommodations
Living with host families in Quito gives students a truly immersive experience. These local families host one LASS student each for maximum cultural and language engagement. Students routinely rate the homestay experience as their favorite part of studying abroad.

All housing offers glimpses of everyday life, with easy access to ACLAS and to city amenities. Homestays include three meals a day (except excursion days) and laundry. Every family has been carefully selected by ACLAS staff in order to ensure a comfortable, enjoyable living situation.

### Cost
The 17-semester-hour credits program includes an additional fee of $1,000. Please note this fee is subject to change. The fee is incorporated into the tuition for one of the LASS courses and is paid as part of the student spring registration. The fee covers: housing, meals, courses and trips in Ecuador. Students are responsible for separately purchasing their airline tickets and making their own arrangements.
