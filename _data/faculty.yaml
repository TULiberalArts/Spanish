  expertise: "Spanish Sociolinguistics, Spanish Dialectology, Language and Gender, Language Contact"
  bio: >
    I am a Spanish sociolinguist with particular research interests that include language and gender, theoretical issues in Spanish phonology and syntax, and language contact. My research has drawn on community based studies in Cantabria, North Spain, and in central Puerto Rico. My most recent research has allowed me to extend my work to another geographical area, the “altiplano” in the region of Chimaltenango, in Guatemala. Under a Temple University Seed Grant Award and also an Internationalization Grant from Temple, I am working on a collaborative project with Dr. Hana Muzika Kahn (also from our department). We are combining our backgrounds in sociolinguistics and comparative literature to study language contact in a bilingual community where Spanish and Kaqchikel Maya are spoken. The foci are both the sociolinguistics of language contact in the community and oral narrative traditions in Spanish and Kaqchikel.

  bio: >
    I had never thought about becoming a linguist, in fact, I did not even know that linguistics existed as a formal course of study and research, until later in life when I already had embarked on a career as a chemist, another passion of mine. It did not occur to me then that structure, change and development are inherent to the two fields. So, the move from chemical to language structures and mixing was not as radical as it may sound. My research encompasses several language types and speech communities and it is formally and empirically informed by theories of contact linguistics. I could outline my research projects as follows: (1) Pidgins Creoles and Cognitive-Based Linguistic Theory: Cognitive-based models of language study such as grammaticalization theory applied to lexico-semantics and pragmatic-discourse in Portuguese- and Spanish-lexified Creoles as a mechanism to explain common patterns and developmental trends in comparative creolistics. (2) Language Use, City and Identity: By studying the Quechua and Spanish varieties spoken by urban migrants from Santiago del Estero (northwestern Argentina), living in Buenos Aires, I would like to know more about how bilingual minority groups adapt their communicative practices as an integral component for redefining identity. The study examines language choices and structural changes in language varieties used by migrant Santiagueños as a way to pose basic questions about the relationship between language, the city and identity. (3) Language Contact and Political Borders: Barranquenho is a mixed Spanish-Portuguese dialect spoken in the town of Barrancos in southern Portugal. I’d like to understand how theories of second language acquisition, sociolinguistics and contact linguistics can explain the fuzzy linguistic boundaries separating the regional dialects on both sides of the political Portuguese-Spanish border. (4) Natural Second Language Learning and Representation in Literary Texts: The application of natural second language learning and contact linguistics perspectives to representation in literary texts involving Spanish and Portuguese in contact with Indigenous languages.

  bio: >
    I was born in Lima (Perú) and I have always felt a strong attraction to literature. I see myself basically as a reader and, in second place, as a scholar. My areas of specialization include numerous topics in the field of contemporary Latin American literature, particularly in connection to the production of autobiographical narratives and the development of modern and postmodern fiction in the Andean region. My interest in exploring the connections between literature and the other arts in 20th century Spanish American and Andean literatures has been a constant throughout my career. My approach to the teaching of modern Latin American literatures and cultures, particularly in my fields of specialization (contemporary fiction, autobiographical writings, contemporary Latin American film, Andean literatures) is based on the interdisciplinary, intermedial and intercultural presentation of representative literary and cultural textualities that express the depth and intricacies of collective subjectivity.

  bio: >
    A Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley, my areas of specialization are 19th and 20th century Brazilian and Spanish American literature, poetics and postcolonial thought from a comparative, Latin American context. Bridging these historically divided fields, three problems guide my research: 1) the constructivist, radical reflexive turn in Brazilian poetics and art during the 1950s and 60s; 2) the legacies of the historical Latin American avant-gardes, especially Brazilian Modernismo and Antropofagia; and 3) the crisis, examination, and discussion of literature and nation-state discourses in the twentieth century and, in consequence, the literary’s uneven relation with politics and gender in Latin American Studies today. No doubt, my aim is to forge a new view of the problem nexus, and state of affairs in the field, that fruitfully underwrite this discussion. My book, entitled, Anti-Literature: The Politics and Limits of Representation in Modern Brazil and Argentina (forthcoming Fall 2016, University of Pittsburgh Press), articulates a rethinking of the fundamental concepts of what is meant by “literature” in contemporary Latin American studies. Through a multilayered theoretical analysis that engages the work of such writers as Clarice Lispector, Oswald de Andrade, the Brazilian Concrete poets, Osman Lins and David Viñas, the book addresses the problematic of experimental writing as a site for radical reflection and reaction to contemporary conditions. In particular, I explore the importance of Brazil to the ongoing discussion about the “nature” of Latin American literature and the need for a globally minded, inter-American framework. By paying especial attention to Brazilian and Argentine anti-literature as crucial to the rise of a new kind of thinking about literature, this book endeavors to change the larger discussion about the historical projection and critical force of Latin American literature. Coinciding with my ongoing field research in Brazil and Spanish America where I am in dialogue with such leading poets as Augusto de Campos, Ferreira Gullar and Frederico Barbosa, my next book project is centered in a reassessment of Brazilian Concrete Poetry and Art.

  expertise: "Spanish, Linguistics, Applied linguistics, Second language acquisition, Language learning, Pedagogy, Morphosyntax, Grammar"
  bio: >
    After growing up in Rochester, New York, and attending college in Cleveland, Ohio, I received my doctorate in Spanish applied linguistics from the University of Pittsburgh in 1997. Before coming to Temple in 2008, I held faculty positions at the University of Akron, in Ohio, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. RESEARCH INTERESTS: As an applied linguist, my research focuses on the acquisition of Spanish morphosyntax (grammar) in second language classrooms. Specifically, I have investigated the impact of different communicative and task-based approaches to grammar instruction on learners’ knowledge of Spanish pronouns and verb meanings. I have also conducted research on cohesion in classroom interaction and the ways in which teachers’ discourse turns affect learner participation. Currently, I am investigating learning processes and outcomes for inductive and deductive approaches to grammar instruction that use culturally-valid, second-language texts. Other forthcoming work includes a monograph to be published by Routledge on the ways that linguistic, cognitive, and sociocultural theories may inform classroom practice. TEACHING INTERESTS: It has been my privilege to work with students from a variety of social backgrounds in a broad range of courses. I have taught all levels of Spanish language, as well as graduate and undergraduate courses on second language acquisition, linguistics, and pedagogy. In graduate courses, I aim to help learners understand the scope of inquiry and investigative tools that different theoretical approaches offer. Through our assignments and discussions, I encourage students to explore the implications of research for language teaching and learning in light of the cognitive, social, and linguistic factors involved. Meanwhile, in writing, grammar, and linguistics courses, I favor an inductive approach where learners must draw conclusions about Spanish structure and use based on a range of culturally-authentic sources. Finally, as a language instructor, I am committed to carefully-planned teaching that emphasizes purposeful, accurate interaction for cross-cultural communication. I advocate a task-based, integrative skills approach in line with the ACTFL National Standards, and draw on learner interests, target-language media and community resources as the basis for classroom interaction. I believe that cultural, literary, and popular texts provide both a rich source of linguistic models for learning, and an ideal point of departure for engaging learners with the diverse world views of Spanish-speaking communities. In all my courses, the dynamic and diverse student body at Temple continually inspires me to be a better teacher, and I am honored to contribute to their personal and professional development.

  bio: >
    I earned my B.A. in Hispanic Literatures at the University of Zaragoza (Spain) and the University of Birmingham (UK). A PhD from Stony Brook University, my research focuses on Seventeenth Century Spain and Colonial America, with a special emphasis on poetry, libidinal forces, and medical history in the transition to the capitalist mode of production. In a Spinozan fashion, I seek to explore those elements of excess that can account for historical change without resorting to externalist explanations or a reductive form of agency. My first book (Góngora: hacia un poética histórica), analyzed the works of Góngora – and particularly his popular verse – precisely in terms of its monstrous inadequacy to the epistemological framework of the Baroque. In this book, I claim that it is Góngora’s heavy investment in feudal purity what paradoxically puts into play a political breakthrough that will set up, in time, the ground conditions for literary “modernity”. This growing interest in the imaginary coordinates of the political has led me to examine how codified rules are rooted in states of exception, particularly in regards to the way legal and medical discourses remain intertwined in the figure of the early modern monster. My second and upcoming book, Cuerpos plegables: anatomías de la excepción en España y América Latina (siglos XVI-XVIII), exemplifies this line of research. I have written articles about Manrique, Cervantes, Góngora or Espinosa Medrano, among others. Currently, I am preparing the first critical edition of Feliciana Enríquez de Guzmán’s Tragicomedia de los jardines y campos sabeos, a drama written by one of the few woman playwrights in Early Modern Spain, which will be published next year as a part of a larger project of cultural heritage recovery and archival restoration funded by the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid.
